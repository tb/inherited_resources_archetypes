= Archetype

Archetype is a tool to support archetype-based apprach to share controllers and views behaviours.

It can help you to manage controllers and views code with reuse in mind.

= Installation

Add do Gemfile

    gem 'archetype_helpers', :git => 'git://github.com/tb/archetype_helpers.git'

= Usage

Create an initializer with following code:

    Archetype::Base.register_archetype :crud do
      inherit_resources
      append_view_path Helpers::Resolver.new("archetype/crud")
      include Helpers::InheritedResources::OnUpdateSuccessRedirectToEdit
      include Helpers::InheritedResources::OnCreateSuccessRedirectToEdit
      include Helpers::PerPage
    end

Now you can define your controller, for example:

    class UsersController < ApplicationController
      archetype :crud
    end

The action templates for the action will be taked from "views/archetype/crud".
Archetype comes with a default set of vies for 'crud' archetype, so unless
you want to overwrite those, all you have to do is define partials like those:

    _form.html.erb
    _list.html.erb
    _list_item.erb
